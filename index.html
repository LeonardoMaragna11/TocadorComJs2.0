                The warden threw a party in the county jail
                The prison band was there, and they began to wail
                The band was jumpin', and the joint began to swing
                You should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing
                Let's rock
                Everybody, let's rock
                Everybody in the whole cell block
                Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
                Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
                The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
                The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang
                Let's rock
                Everybody, let's rock
                Everybody in the whole cell block
                Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Number forty-seven said to number three
                "You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see"
                "I sure would be delighted with your company"
                "Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
                Let's rock
                Everybody, let's rock
                Everybody in the whole cell block
                Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Sad Sack was sittin' on a block of stone
                Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
                The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
                "If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"
                Let's rock
                Everybody, let's rock
                Everybody in the whole cell block
                Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Shifty Henry said to Bugs
                "For Heaven's sake"
                "No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break"
                Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix"
                "I wanna stick around awhile and get my kicks"
                Let's rock
                Everybody, let's rock
                Everybody in the whole cell block
                Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
                Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
